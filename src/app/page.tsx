              At Re:Thread, we connect pre-loved clothing with the people who need it most in and around Vancouver, BC.
              By partnering with local hospitals, schools, and community organizations,
              we make sure every donated item finds a new home.

              Recent research found that Canadians disposed of nearly 500 million kilograms of textiles in a single calendar year.
              Much of this clothing could have been reused to help those in need. This is why we are
              dedicated to giving clothes a second chance. At Re:Thread, we collect donations from the local community,
              sort, and prepare them with the help of our volunteers, who deliver them directly to homeless shelters,
              rehabilitation centers, housing programs, and any institutions in need. Our goal is simple: reduce clothing waste
              while making sure the people who need it most have access to clean, quality clothing. Join us on our journey to
              build a stronger, more caring community, one hoodie at a time!
